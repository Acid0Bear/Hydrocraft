description=There are 2 other main hydrocraft mods. One is the b40 version made by Hydromancerx and is no longer being updated. The other one is by David Hasihoff on steam. This was the [b]previous[/b] version of hydrocraft for b41, but is now no longer updated. I am now taking over with some help to continue fixing and improving Hydrocraft as a whole.
